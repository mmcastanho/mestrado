abstract = {In this paper, a fuzzy ontology and its application to news summarization are presented. The fuzzy ontology with fuzzy concepts is an extension of the domain ontology with crisp concepts. It is more suitable to describe the domain knowledge than domain ontology for solving the uncertainty reasoning problems. First, the domain ontology with various events of news is predefined by domain experts. The document preprocessing mechanism will generate the meaningful terms based on the news corpus and the Chinese news dictionary defined by the domain expert. Then, the meaningful terms will be classified according to the events of the news by the term classifier. The fuzzy inference mechanism will generate the membership degrees for each fuzzy concept of the fuzzy ontology. Every fuzzy concept has a set of membership degrees associated with various events of the domain ontology. In addition, a news agent based on the fuzzy ontology is also developed for news summarization. The news agent contains five modules, including a retrieval agent, a document preprocessing mechanism, a sentence path extractor, a sentence generator, and a sentence filter to perform news summarization. Furthermore, we construct an experimental website to test the proposed approach. The experimental results show that the news agent based on the fuzzy ontology can effectively operate for news summarization.},

The lineage of heavy industries and chemical factories with the water sources are dumping loads of harmful wastes to the water sources. To create awareness among people, internet of things (IoT) and wearable sensors through wireless sensor networks (WSN) can be used to facilitate this task. Deployment of such sensors in remote water sources to detect the water quality is made through WSN. This paper reviews about the design of a smart WSN interface (FPGA) for water contamination measurement for the remote water resources, where human presence is very rare. Field programmable gate array (FPGA) is used, which can be programmed and used as the core controller. The proposed system is capable of detecting the chemical changes in the water source in real time by analyzing the sensors and sending the information to the default hub. {\&}copy; Springer India 2016.},

abstract = {Biomedical ontologies are a critical component in biomedical research and practice. As an ontology evolves, its structure and content change in response to additions, deletions and updates. When editing a biomedical ontology, small local updates may affect large portions of the ontology, leading to unintended and potentially erroneous changes. Such unwanted side effects often go unnoticed since biomedical ontologies are large and complex knowledge structures. Abstraction networks, which provide compact summaries of an ontology's content and structure, have been used to uncover structural irregularities, inconsistencies and errors in ontologies. In this paper, we introduce Diff Abstraction Networks ("Diff AbNs"), compact networks that summarize and visualize global structural changes due to ontology editing operations that result in a new ontology release. A Diff AbN can be used to support curators in identifying unintended and unwanted ontology changes. The derivation of two Diff AbNs, the Diff Area Taxonomy and the Diff Partial-area Taxonomy, is explained and Diff Partial-area Taxonomies are derived and analyzed for the Ontology of Clinical Research, Sleep Domain Ontology, and eagle-i Research Resource Ontology. Diff Taxonomy usage for identifying unintended erroneous consequences of quality assurance and ontology merging are demonstrated.},

Semantic aspects of visual information are mainly described in full text attributes or mapped onto specialized, application specific description schemes. Result lists of queries are commonly represented by textual descriptions and single key frames. This approach is valid for text documents and images, but is often insufficient to represent video content in a meaningful way. In this paper we present a multimedia retrieval framework focusing on video objects, which fully relies on the MPEG-7 standard as information base. It provides a content-based retrieval interface which uses hierarchical content-based video summaries to allow for quick viewing and browsing through search results even on bandwidth limited Web applications. Additionally semantic meaning about video content can be annotated based on domain specific ontologies, enabling a more targeted search for content. Our experiences and results with these techniques will be discussed in this paper.},

abstract = {Hybrid Software-Defined Networks (SDNs) are growing at a remarkable speed, so network administrators need to deal with the configuration of a plethora of devices including OpenFlow elements, traditional equipment, and nodes supporting both OpenFlow and traditional features. The OpenFlow Management and Configuration Protocol (OF-CONFIG) is positioned as a solid candidate for the remote configuration of OpenFlow devices, but the fact that OF-CONFIG relies on NETCONF for its transport constrains its potential considerably. Indeed, the lack of comprehensive and standardized data models has hindered the utilization of NETCONF itself in traditional networks, and will likely confine OF-CONFIG to an elementary set of configurations until the expected data models arrive. In this paper, we present a semantic-based approach that eases and automates the configuration of network devices while complementing the capabilities of OF-CONFIG and NETCONF. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows. First, we have formalized the semantics of the switch/router configuration domain using the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Second, we have developed an Ontology-Based Information Extraction (OBIE) system from the Command-Line Interface (CLI) of network devices. Third, we have defined a learning algorithm that enables automated interpretation of CLIs' configuration capabilities in heterogeneous (multi-vendor) network scenarios. The potential of our approach is demonstrated through experiments carried out on different network elements. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

The Vaidurya engine is fully functional and is used within the DeGeL system.

abstract = {Words, sentences, paragraphs and documents is an important component in the data mining application area such as information retrieval, text summarization etc. And finding the similarity value between these components is an important action. Nowaday, there are various matching techniques are present which are very helpful for finding the similarity between the ontology. In this survey paper discusses the existing works on similarity (On text, words etc.) using element-level techniques and structure level techniques.},
