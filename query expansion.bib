abstract = {Sense based query expansion never proved its effectiveness except for the so-called open domain question answering task. The present work is still inconclusive at this regard, due to some experimental limitations, but we provide interesting evidence suggesting new guidelines for future research. Word sense disambiguation is in fact only one of the problems involved with sense based query expansion. The second is how to use sense information (and ontologies in general) to expand the query. We show that expanding with synonyms or hyperonyms has a limited effect on web information retrieval performance, while other types of semantic information derivable from an ontology are much more effective at improving search results.},

@article{Bhogal2007,
abstract = {This paper examines the meaning of context in relation to ontology based query expansion and contains a review of query expansion approaches. The various query expansion approaches include relevance feedback, corpus dependent knowledge models and corpus independent knowledge models. Case studies detailing query expansion using domain-specific and domain-independent ontologies are also included. The penultimate section attempts to synthesise the information obtained from the review and provide success factors in using an ontology for query expansion. Finally the area of further research in applying context from an ontology to query expansion within a newswire domain is described. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{SeguraN2010,
abstract = {This paper presents some research results which assesses the problem of query expansion in search activities. We propose the use of domain ontologies, linguistic processing and validation based on a general dictionary. The work is focused on Learning Object's search in specialized repositories. It includes a review of query expansion methods that can be used in e-learning and a description of a prototype that implement this approach. The results obtained so far allow us to state that the terms added to the query as result of the expansion process provide more specificity in the retrieved elements. Future research aims to demonstrate that with new terms, it is possible to improve relevance in retrieved Learning Objects.},
