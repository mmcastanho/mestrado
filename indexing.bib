abstract = {Indexing of visual media based on content analysis has now moved beyond using individual concept detectors and there is now a focus on combining concepts by post-processing the outputs of individual concept detection. Due to the limitations and availability of training corpora which are usually sparsely and imprecisely labeled with concept groundtruth, training-based refinement methods for semantic indexing of visual media suffer in correctly capturing relationships between concepts, including co-occurrence and ontological relationships. In contrast to training-dependent methods which dominate this field, this paper presents a training-free refinement (TFR) algorithm for enhancing semantic indexing of visual media based purely on concept detection results, making the refinement of initial concept detections based on semantic enhancement, practical and flexible. This is achieved using what can be called multi-semantics, factoring in semantics from multiple sources. In the case of this paper, global and temporal neighbourhood information inferred from the original concept detections in terms of weighted non-negative matrix factorization and neighbourhood-based graph propagation are both used in the refinement of semantics. Furthermore, any available ontological concept relationships among concepts can also be integrated into this model as an additional source of external a priori knowledge. Extended experiments on two heterogeneous datasets, images from wearable cameras and videos from TRECVid, demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed TFR solution.},

abstract = {In this paper, we describe a framework that we have developed for the$\backslash$nsupport of ontology-based semantic indexing and retrieval of audiovisual$\backslash$ncontent following the MPEG-7 and TV-Anytime standard specifications for$\backslash$nmetadata descriptions. Our work aims to provide a methodology to enhance$\backslash$nthe retrieval effectiveness of audiovisual content, while maintaining$\backslash$ncompatibility with the international multimedia standards.$\backslash$nIn our framework, domain-specific ontologies guide the definition of$\backslash$nboth the application-specific metadata and the instance-description$\backslash$nmetadata that describe the contents of audiovisual programs and/or their$\backslash$nsegments. The ontologies are also used in order to provide compatible$\backslash$ndescriptions in both audiovisual content standards (MPEG-7 and$\backslash$nTV-Anytime) for the same content. This approach allows indexing$\backslash$ncompatibility and interoperability of TV-Anytime and digital library$\backslash$napplications.$\backslash$nWe describe the design and implementation of a system supporting this$\backslash$nframework. The components of the system include a segmentation tool for$\backslash$nsegmenting audiovisual information, which also provides ontology-based$\backslash$nsemantic indexing capabilities, and an appropriate API for semantic$\backslash$nquery support.

abstract = {ldquoCurse of dimensionalityrdquo is a common problem in the area of information retrieval. It was verified that points in a vector space are projected to a random subspace of suitably high dimension, and then the distances between the points are approximately preserved. Although such a random projection can be used to reduce the dimension of the document space, it does not bring together semantically related documents. Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) projects documents to lower dimensional LSI space from higher dimensional term space with singular-value decomposition (SVD) for the purpose of reducing the dimensions of the document space and bringing together semantically related documents. But the computation time of SVD is a bottleneck because of the higher dimensions of documents. In this paper, a novel method of dimension reduction for improving LSI is provided. A term-to-concept projection matrix based on domain ontology was created in this method. This way documents were projected to lower dimensional concept space by the projection matrix. LSI pre-computation was performed not on the original term by document matrix, but on the lower dimensional concept by document matrix at great computational savings. Experiments indicate that this method improves the efficiency of LSI. And the similarity judgment between documents is not disturbed.},

abstract = {This paper presents a system implemented to evaluate the retrieval efficiency of images when they are semantically indexed using a combination of a web ontology language and the low-level features of the image. Finding a similarity measure algorithm to retrieve images based on the semantic metadata can be very challenging due to diverse image content and inadequate domain-specific ontologies describing the content. The existing methods for indexing images are primarily based on text. While these methods are widely used due to their simplicity, they are not very efficient as they require a domain expert and the textual interpretations of image content vary from person to person. In our approach, we leverage sophisticated image-processing techniques to automatically extract image content information into MPEG-7 format and associate them to the existing domain ontologies developed by experts, thereby, bridging the gap between low-level features and high-level semantics. This implementation and validation experiments show that a high retrieval accuracy rate is obtained when all the image descriptors are combined with an ontology while building the semantic metadata for indexing images. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The study presented in this paper focuses on the preprocessing stage of image retrieval by proposing an ontology-based indexing approach which captures the meaning of image annotations by extracting the semantic importance of the words in them. The indexing algorithm is based on the classic vector-space model that is adapted by employing index weighting and a word sense disambiguation. It uses sets of Semantic DNA, extracted from a lexical ontology, to represent the images in a vector space. As discussed in the paper, the use of Semantic DNA in text-based image retrieval aims to overcome some of the major drawbacks of well known traditional approaches such as {\&}{\#}x2018;bags of words{\&}{\#}x2019; and term frequency-(TF) based indexing. The proposed approach is evaluated by comparing the indexing achieved using the proposed semantic algorithm with results obtained using a traditional TF-based indexing in vector space model (VSM) with singular value decomposition (SVD) technique. The experimental results show that the proposed ontology-based approach generates a better-quality index which captures the conceptual meaning of the image annotations.},

abstract = {By riding the tide of sensor technologies, smart space services collects information about its surroundings and internal objects. However, sensor readings are usually at primitive stage and difficult to be viewed and further retrieved since they have little meaning for naive users, who usually prefer to identify activities or state changes using high-level semantics or concepts. To bridge this gap, we propose an ontology-driven event processing framework as part of the middleware for smart spaces. Smart space event ontology (SSEO) is developed to enable semantic indexing, detect machine-processable events and exchange event data between different processes. A model named Smart Space Event Processors (SSEP) maintains and coordinates various event processes (e.g., event patterns, ontology reasoning rules, and machine-learning algorithms) for semantic events in a smart space. An implementation of SSEP-OntoCEP is introduced. The model elaborates on event composition and semantic labeling by combining event composition technology and semantic reasoning into one coherent system. It has been applied in a smart-space infrastructure named SENSIP.},

In general, we deal with three issues in semantic search, namely, usability, scalability and retrieval performance. We propose a keyword-based semantic retrieval approach. The performance of the system is improved considerably using domain-specific information extraction, inferencing and rules. Scalability is achieved by adapting a semantic indexing approach and representing the whole world as small independent models. The system is implemented using the state-of-the-art technologies in Semantic Web and its performance is evaluated against traditional systems as well as the query expansion methods.
