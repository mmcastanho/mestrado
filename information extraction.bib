abstract = {In order to solve medical multimodal queries, we propose to split the queries in different dimensions using ontology. We extract both textual and visual terms depending on the ontology dimension they belong to. Based on these terms, we build different sub queries each corresponds to one query dimension. Then we use boolean expressions on these sub queries to filter the entire document collection. The filtred document set is ranked lists generated using both text and image indexes to further improve the retrieval performance. We have achieved the best overall performance for the medical image retrieval task in CLEF 2005. These experimental results show that while most queries are better handled by the text query processing as most semantic information are contained in the medical text cases, both textual and visual ontology dimensions are complementary in improving the results during media fusion.},

abstract = {In this paper we present the design, implementation and evaluation of SOBA, a system for ontology-based information extraction from heterogeneous data resources, including plain text, tables and image captions. SOBA is capable of processing structured information, text and image captions to extract information and integrate it into a coherent knowledge base. To establish coherence, SOBA interlinks the information extracted from different sources and detects duplicate information. The knowledge base produced by SOBA can then be used to query for information contained in the different sources in an integrated and seamless manner. Overall, this allows for advanced retrieval functionality by which questions can be answered precisely. A further distinguishing feature of the SOBA system is that it straightforwardly integrates deep and shallow natural language processing to increase robustness and accuracy. We discuss the implementation and application of the SOBA system within the SmartWeb multimodal dialog system. In addition, we present a thorough evaluation of the different components of the system. However, an end-to-end evaluation of the whole SmartWeb system is out of the scope of this paper and has been presented elsewhere by the SmartWeb consortium.},

abstract = {Information Extraction (IE) has existed as a field for several decades and has produced some impressive systems in the recent past. Despite its success, widespread usage and commercialization remain elusive goals for this field. We identify the lack of effective mechanisms for reuse as one major reason behind this situation. Here, we mean not only the reuse of the same IE technique in different situations but also the reuse of information related to the application of IE techniques (e.g., features used for classification). We have developed a comprehensive component-based approach for information extraction that promotes reuse to address this situation. We designed this approach starting from our previous work on the use of multiple ontologies in information extraction [24]. The key ideas of our approach are "information extractors," which are components of an IE system that make extractions with respect to particular components of an ontology and "platforms for IE," which are domain and corpus independent implementations of IE techniques. A case study has shown that this component-based approach can be successfully applied in practical situations.},
